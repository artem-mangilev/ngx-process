# ngx-process

This is a library for creating fully customizable graphs. The main focuses are:

- deep customization (to meet your's company design)
- simple and powerful API
- good typings
- wide editing abilities (like creating edges from UI)
- ability to implement any flowchart notation (like BPMN or even your custom)

## ngx-graph

This library was initially cloned from awesome [ngx-graph](https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-graph) as a good starting point. The main limitation of ngx-graph is that it only works in read-only mode, you cannot edit edges from UI.

Later I will add a comparison table between two libraries.
